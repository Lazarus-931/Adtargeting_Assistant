    "response": "Based on the provided sample data:\n\n1. This appears to be e-commerce data, possibly from an online marketplace or retail website. The data seems to contain information about products, their categories, prices, ratings, and reviews. It also includes details about the customers who bought and reviewed the products, such as their names, the titles and bodies of their reviews, and the number of people who found their reviews helpful. However, the data sample is not properly formatted, and most of the rows contain NaN values, which means that the data is missing or not available.\n\n2. The most important columns would likely depend on the specific analysis or business questions at hand. However, generally speaking, the following columns could be considered important: 'search_query' (to understand what customers are looking for), 'category' and 'subcategory' (to understand the types of products being sold or reviewed), 'Name' (to identify the specific products), 'Price' (to analyze the product pricing), 'Rating' and 'Reviews' (to assess customer satisfaction and product quality), 'number_bought_last_month' (to track sales performance), and 'review_rating' (to further analyze customer feedback).\n\n3. One question that could be answered with this data is: \"What are the most popular products in each category based on the number of items bought last month and the average customer rating?\" This would involve analyzing the 'category', 'Name', 'number_bought_last_month', and 'Rating' columns. However, to answer this question, we would need a complete and properly formatted dataset.",
